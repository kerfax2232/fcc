Regarding formatting: indenting is apparently where sublime text finally decides to say fuck you.  Fix this by:
ctrl+shift+p
search box opens
search for indent(ation)
indentation: reindent lines *should* auto-fix the html indent issue.

It's stupid.  Now onto the show...


What needs to be done:

- links at top of page to each section.  unsure how this is done, especially with everything on one page?
  - ideally, this also highlights each section as moved, but i don't think this was part of the training so that will be more of a "get back to this at some point" exercise
- h2/h3 type element with background colors added
-image for portfolio.  ideally stylized (i believe via bootstrap) to be a shape rather than just image
- h2 heading to begin portfolio section
- ideally some sort of design to break up space
- images of design (or fake designs)
- contact section
- form fields for contacting, with text filled in indicating what to be filled out
- submit button
- <p> element with additional contact info

Overall, I want this to use more of the mix of jquery, css and html that i actually learned, rather than just css and html as in my bullshit tribute page from before.

<div class="container-fluid">
	<div>
	<!-- Background for contact, about me and portfolio.  Possibly links as well if using jquery background fill for parent vs. child elements?  see jqueryfinal.html for example -->
	</div>

</div>
